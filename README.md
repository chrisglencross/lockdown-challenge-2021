# Lockdown Challenge 2021

Some logic, cryptography, computer science-y puzzles, challenges and activities that I've written during the UK lockdown
of January 2021, as something for my kids (ages 13 and 15) to do.

Don't look in the scripts directory if you'd prefer not to see spoilers.

## Contents

Materials are in the docs directories.

* Day 1: Parity bits
* Day 2: Pseudo Random Number Generator
* Day 3: Simple Substitution Cipher
* Day 4: Huffman Encoding
* Day 5: ? (you might not have the materials to solve this one)
* Day 6: LZ Compression
* Day 7: Vign√®re Cipher
* Day 8: Asymmetric Cryptography

## Possible Future Topics:

* Checksums and secure hashes.
* Signing with public keys (see how Day 8 goes down first)
* Image compression
